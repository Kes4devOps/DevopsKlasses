In February 2014, the Hennessey Venom GT reached a speed of 270.49mph (435.3km/h)—which unofficially broke the world record for the fastest car in the world. Allegedly, the car couldn’t be tested in both directions due to organizational difficulties and therefore the record remains unofficial. However, the car currently holds the world record for the fastest production car and there is no doubt that this machine is a real super car. The Hennessey Venom GT has a V8 twin turbo engine and costs around $1.2 million. In December last year, the UK manufacturer announced that 11 of the proposed 29 Hennessey cars were already sold.
